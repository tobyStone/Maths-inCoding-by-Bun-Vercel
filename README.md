... a 'helper' site alongside my maths teaching. I will use this to help children learn curriculum maths by coding computer games.  

I have worked in many types of school with many pupils who have been excluded from mainstream education. Often, children don't see the point of maths when learnt from a textbook. In games, maths makes the coding work. Without maths; no game. This is my hands-on approach to pedagogy in action: playing a video on coding a Scratch game and checking, in the video, if the students understand the maths involved. If not, a video loads to explain it.
